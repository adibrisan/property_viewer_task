Each marker (house icon) on the map is clickable and will open a form where you can edit the building's details.

Here we can see a simple list a few details of each building from our portofolio.

The pen icon let's you edit the selected building.

FOR BOTH TABS:

Up in the right corner, there is a search input where you can search by a building's name.

A new building can be added with the bottom-right button.
